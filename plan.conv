Phase 1: Lock the domain logic (highest leverage, lowest pain)
Goal

Make it impossible for transcript logic to be wrong.

What to build

A pure Python core that handles:

Transcript segments

Word timing redistribution

Grouping

Take selection rules

Alignment logic

Characteristics

No HTML

No JS

No browser

No media

100% test coverage

Runs in isolation

Why this matters

This is the brain of everything:

Timeline

Video grid

AI grouping

Playback sync

If this is solid, UI bugs become annoying instead of existential.

Deliverable (concrete)

A Python package like:

transcript_core/
├─ segments.py
├─ timing.py
├─ grouping.py
├─ selection.py
└─ tests/


You should be able to say:

“Given transcript X, I know exactly which take should play and when.”

That’s real progress.

Phase 2: Server-side integration without interactivity
Goal

Prove the core logic works end-to-end without complex UI.

What to build

Flask app

Renders transcript

Calls Python core

Displays results as plain text or lists

What NOT to do

No timeline canvas

No dragging

No synchronized playback

No video grid

Why

This gives you:

Confidence

Debuggability

A stable bridge between logic and UI

If something is wrong here, it’s not HTML. It’s logic.

Phase 3: Minimal JS for intent, not layout
Goal

Use JavaScript only to express user intent.

Examples:

“User selected segment A”

“User switched take”

“User pressed read”

Rules

JS does not compute

JS does not decide

JS does not synchronize

JS just emits events

This keeps JS testable and boring.

Phase 4: Single-view interactivity (choose ONE)

This is where you stop boiling the ocean.

Pick exactly ONE to build first:
Option A: Transcript-first editor

Click text

Selection state

Read aloud

Take switching

Ignore timeline and grid completely.

Option B: Timeline-only prototype

Fake transcript

Focus on zoom, scroll, selection

Ignore video and text editing.

Option C: Video grid-only comparison

Fixed transcript

Focus on playback sync

Ignore editing entirely.

👉 You must pick one.
Trying to do all three is why you feel stuck.

Phase 5: Browser automation (only here)
When it enters

Only after:

The core logic is solid

One interactive surface exists

Bugs are visual or timing-related

What to automate first

Exactly one golden path:

Click transcript → playback updates

Or drag timeline → selection updates

Or switch take → correct video plays

One test. Not a suite.
