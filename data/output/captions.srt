00:00:00,204 --> 00:00:03,971
Where there was not God's folk, and then there was. Welcome

00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:07,760
to Life is your word episode three. In this show, we build up our

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,531
understanding of reality by by seeking God's face. Today's

4
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:15,171
reading is from Genesis chapter one. Welcome to Life is your word

5
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:18,731
episode three. In this show, we build up our understanding of

6
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:22,551
reality by seeking God's face. Today's

7
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:26,491
reading is from Genesis chapter one. When God began to create the heavens and the

8
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:30,331
earth, the earth was in complete

9
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:34,251
chaos and darkness covered the face of the

10
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:38,132
Jeep. While a wind of God, swept over the face

11
00:00:38,132 --> 00:00:39,132
of the waters,

12
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:43,612
then God said, let there be light and there was

13
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:46,352
light. And God saw that

14
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:49,712
the light was good

15
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:53,472
and God separated the light from the

16
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:56,272
darkness. God created humans in the image of God.

17
00:00:57,232 --> 00:00:58,531
God blessed them,

18
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:02,811
saying be fruitful and fill the earth.

19
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:07,232
I have given you everything. In my past death,

20
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:11,172
I lived in complete chaos and

21
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:14,872
the great darkness of depression covered

22
00:01:14,872 --> 00:01:17,352
my face. I stopped listening to God's voice

23
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:19,632
and I tried

24
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:24,752
rather than by Christ living in me.

25
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,692
But God's, but then God spoke

26
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:31,132
and I became. Life filled me.

27
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,712
Peace beyond human understanding. Joy that defied world the authorities.

28
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:39,512
And I became compelled to shout God's praise from every

29
00:01:39,512 --> 00:01:43,212
mountain top and share God's great works with everyone.

30
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:47,031
So I thank God regularly for my role in

31
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:50,631
partaking in creation as I create these things for your

32
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:54,212
benefit just as God created all things for our

33
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:55,212
benefit.

34
00:01:56,391 --> 00:01:57,391
This

35
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:01,731
This reminds me that nothing is impossible through Christ

36
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:02,731
who gives me

37
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:05,311
the one who

38
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:09,932
your life too. What death have you

39
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:15,632
And how does he speak you into being and life? Share your revelations in

40
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:16,632
the comments.

41
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:18,711
In love and unity, Ace of El.
